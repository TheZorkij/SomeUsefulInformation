### Invaluable shortcuts in Spacemacs for Clojure REPL
* _Alt p_: scroll REPL history.
* _SPC m s i_: creates a CIDER REPL and connects to it. I always have one running when Iâ€™m writing any Clojure code.
* _SPC m h n_: brings up a menu to browse the namespace. I primarily use this to access Clojure.core, to see a list of available functions, and to quickly navigate to the source code.
* _SPC m e b_: evaluates the buffer, SPC m e f evaluates the function, and SPC m e f evaluates the selected region in the REPL.
* _SPC m s b_: loads the buffer in the running REPL, which is very handy for testing several functions.
* _SPC m s f_: loads the function at the cursor in the running REPL.
* _SPC m t a_: runs all of the tests in the namespace, while SPC m t t runs the test under the cursor.
